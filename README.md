Every year, the developers of the online video game Warframe do a year-end divulgence of what players have been using in their missions. I decided to try my hand at analyzing the data using Python's pandas library. I then plotted my findings using Plotly.

Given a messy spreadsheet, I cleaned and combined multiple sheets detailing reported crimes in Baltimore. I then uploaded that data and visualized it through Tableau.

## Data Engineering
### CoupBot Data Engineering Project

Utilizing Apache Airflow, I set up and automated a process that takes the data generated from the CoupBot Discord server and uploads it to a local PSQL server, where it can easy be analyzed. 

### Epic Games Store Scraper and Embed Poster
[Github Link](https://github.com/Jlevy0/Epic-Games-Store-Scraper-and-Embed-Poster)

An automated web scraping pipeline that checks the Epic Games Store for free games. If one is found, it posts the store link to a Discord server in the form of an embed.
